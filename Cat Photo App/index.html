<!-- Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers
In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework. Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design. With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width. You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML: -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster"
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
/>
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<!-- We should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with the class container-fluid. -->
<div class="container-fluid">
  <!-- using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element -->
  <h2 class="red-text text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2>

  <p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"
    ><img
      class="smaller-image thick-green-border"
      src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
      alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
  /></a>

  <!-- It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen. Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page. -->
  <img
    class="img-responsive"
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg"
  />

  <!-- Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones. Give it the btn and btn-default classes -->
  <!-- Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block. -->
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Like</button>
